## üìñ Overview

Attendify is a robust, dual-panel attendance application designed for organizations that require a reliable and fraud-proof method to track employee attendance. It leverages **Geofencing** via Google Maps and **on-device Facial Authentication** to ensure that attendance is only marked when an employee is physically present at the designated location.

- **Admin Panel:** Manage employees, register their facial data, and monitor real-time attendance reports.
- **User Panel:** Employees can securely check in and out by verifying their location and identity.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîê Multi-Factor Authentication
- **Geolocation Verification:** Uses Google Maps Polygon to create a virtual geofence around the office. Attendance is only allowed if the user's device is inside this boundary.
- **Facial Biometric Authentication:** Captures a live image via the device camera and uses ML Kit & TFLite to match the employee's face against pre-registered embeddings stored securely in Firebase.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Admin Panel
- Add, view, and manage employees.
- Register facial data for new employees through an intuitive camera interface.
- View and export detailed attendance reports for any employee or date range.

### üë§ User Panel
- Secure login using credentials provided by the admin.
- Simple check-in/check-out workflow that automatically triggers location and face verification.
- View personal attendance history.

### üìä Real-Time Dashboard
- Admins get a live overview of who is currently checked in, late, or absent.
- Data is synced in real-time using Cloud Firestore.

### üîî Push Notifications
- Users receive instant confirmation upon successful check-in/out.
- Admins can be alerted for specific events (e.g., failed authentication attempts).
